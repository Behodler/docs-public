## TL;DR

- Phoenix earns real stable yield using Protocol-Owned Capital (POC).
- Every phUSD mint increases POC by 100%, but not all minted phUSD is staked.
- This mismatch causes yield per staked unit to exceed market yield.
- The yield premium is the extra return stakers earn because some minted phUSD is sold instead of staked — the fewer people that stake, the higher the premium becomes.
- As long as some minting involves selling, the premium is strictly positive.
- Arbitrage and MEV activity grow POC instead of extracting value.
- Total yield capacity compounds over time as POC grows.

## Step 1 — The Baseline Market Yield (K)

Assume the prevailing stablecoin yield in DeFi is:

**K = 3.5%**

This yield comes from lending markets, vault strategies, and other relatively low-risk sources. Capital naturally flows toward any opportunity that offers more than K.

Phoenix deploys its Protocol Owned Capital into these same types of strategies. The protocol therefore earns a real, external, non-inflationary yield.

This establishes the base return of the system.

---

## Step 2 — Yield Generated by POC

Phoenix differs from most protocols in one critical way:

> The capital that generates yield is owned by the protocol, not rented from users.

Let:

- P = Total Protocol Owned Capital deployed into yield strategies  

Annual yield generated:

    Yield = K * P

This yield flows into Phoenix and is distributed to phUSD stakers.

This alone does not yet explain the premium. The premium emerges from how minting affects capital flows.

---

## Step 3 — Minting Grows POC Faster Than Staked Supply

When users mint phUSD, two dominant behaviors appear:

1. Mint-and-stake participants  
2. Mint-and-sell participants (arbitrage, MEV, profit takers)

Key asymmetry:

- 100% of minted phUSD grows Protocol Owned Capital.  
- Less than 100% of minted phUSD ends up staked.

Let:

- s = Fraction of newly minted phUSD that is staked, where 0 < s < 1.

For a mint of size M:

- POC increases by M  
- Staked supply increases by s * M  

POC therefore grows faster than staked capital.

---

## Step 4 — Where the Yield Premium "p" Comes From

Let:

- P = Protocol Owned Capital  
- S = Total phUSD staked  

Yield generated:

    Y = K * P

Staking yield:

    R = Y / S = (K * P) / S

    The yield each staker earns equals the total yield generated by the protocol, divided by how much phUSD is staked.

In steady state:

    P / S ≈ 1 / s

    For every unit of phUSD that is staked, there is roughly 1 divided by the staked fraction worth of protocol capital backing it.

So:

    R ≈ K / s

    The effective staking yield equals the market yield divided by the fraction of phUSD that gets staked.

Premium:

    p = R - K = K * ((1 - s) / s)

    The yield premium is the extra return above market yield created by the portion of phUSD that was sold instead of staked.

If s < 1, then p > 0.

---

## Step 5 — Why the Premium Does Not Collapse

When Phoenix offers higher yield than the market:

- Capital flows into staking.  
- The staked fraction s increases.  
- The premium compresses naturally.

However, Phoenix structurally creates persistent mint-and-sell opportunities:

- phUSD has a fixed mint price.  
- Market demand, LP fees, yield pairing, and price pressure create arbitrage windows.  
- Arbitrage requires selling phUSD to realize profit.

As long as profit exists, some selling exists. Therefore s never reaches 1 and the premium never disappears.

MEV activity becomes a growth engine rather than an extractive force.

---

## Step 6 — Why This Grows Protocol Owned Capital Faster Than Supply

- Each mint increases POC fully.  
- Only a fraction increases staked supply.  
- Yield capacity compounds structurally.  
- Capital cannot flee.  
- No inflation is required.

---

## Step 7 — Why Down Markets Strengthen Phoenix (Rebound Economics)

- POC producing K remains relatively constant.  
- phUSD price can fluctuate.  
- Lower phUSD price increases APY for those buying phUSD on the open market  
- Buy-and-Stake demand increases.  
- Liquidity deepens.  
- Price stabilizes and rebounds.

Volatility becomes a compounding mechanism rather than a risk.
This volatility is expected at the beginning of Phoenix but reduces over time as liquidity deepens.

---

## Step 8 — The Virtuous Cycle

1. External yield produces base return K.  
2. Minting grows Protocol Owned Capital.  
3. Partial staking creates premium p.  
4. Yield attracts capital.  
5. Arbitrage continues minting.  
6. POC compounds further.  
7. Yield capacity expands.  
8. The loop repeats.

---

## Step 9 — Why This Matters Beyond phUSD

As POC grows:

- Yield can incentivise ecosystem assets such as SCX, Flax, and EYE.  
- The protocol becomes increasingly antifragile.  
- The protocol gains increasing strategic flexibility and future decision-making power as its owned capital base grows.  
- Phoenix compounds value by accumulating productive assets rather than inflating token supply.

Phoenix does not promise yield.
It engineers the economic conditions that produce it.

## Appendix 1 — Base Example

Assume:
- Market yield: K = 3.5%  
- Fraction staked: s = 0.7  

Then:

    R = 3.5% / 0.7 = 5.0%
    p = 1.5%

## Appendix 2 — Sensitivity of Premium to Staking Ratio

| s (Staked Fraction) | Effective Yield R | Premium p |
|---------------------|-------------------|------------|
| 0.50                | 7.0%              | 3.5%       |
| 0.60                | 5.83%             | 2.33%      |
| 0.70                | 5.00%             | 1.50%      |
| 0.80                | 4.38%             | 0.88%      |
| 0.90                | 3.89%             | 0.39%      |

As long as s < 1, premium remains positive.

## Appendix 3 — POC Growth and Yield Amplification Example

Assume:
- Initial POC = 1,000  
- Initial staked supply = 1,000  
- Market yield K = 5%  
- Mint wave M = 200  
- s = 0.7  

Initial state:
- Annual yield = 1,000 × 5% = 50  
- Effective staking APY = 50 / 1,000 = 5.0%  

After one mint wave:
- New POC = 1,200  
- New staked increase = 140  
- New staked supply = 1,140  

- Annual yield = 1,200 × 5% = 60  
- Effective staking APY = 60 / 1,140 ≈ 5.26%  

After five mint waves:
- New POC = 2,000  
- Total staked added = 700  
- New staked supply = 1,700  

- Annual yield = 2,000 × 5% = 100  
- Effective staking APY = 100 / 1,700 ≈ 5.88%  

Even though the underlying market yield remains constant at 5%, 
the effective staking yield increases because POC grows faster 
than staked supply whenever s < 1.

This yield amplification is the source of the premium p.
